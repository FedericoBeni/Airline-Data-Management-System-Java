# Java Airline Data Query System

A Java application developed for the Object-Oriented Programming exam. The project implements a system to parse, model, and query a dataset for an airline's operations, including its fleet, airports, and flights.

## Project Goal

The main objective is to design and build an object-oriented system capable of answering a series of complex data queries based on a given set of specifications. The focus is on clean data modeling, logical encapsulation, and algorithmic problem-solving in Java.

## Core Tasks

The program is required to solve three distinct tasks:

1.  **Task 1: General Queries**
    -   Performs 8 different analytical queries on the dataset, such as counting entities, finding the busiest airport, and filtering data based on specific attributes.

2.  **Task 2: Conditional Validation**
    -   Evaluates a set of four complex, interdependent rules based on two integer inputs (`p` and `q`) and returns a simple `YES` or `NO` result.

3.  **Task 3: New Data Validation**
    -   Analyzes a new list of flights against the original dataset to verify three specific structural and logical conditions, returning `VALID` or `NOT VALID`.

## Technical Details

-   **Language:** Java
-   **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Design contained within a `progetto` package.
-   **Execution:** The application runs via the `Progetto.java` main class, reading from Standard Input and writing to Standard Output.
